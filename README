An interface to Tokyo Cabinet.  Tokyo Cabinet is a modern
implementation of DBM, similar in spirit to Berkeley DB.  See
http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/

No documentation.
One small test.

We only support the B+ Tree Database.  No transactions.

You will need the Tokyo Cabinet Java library as well as the Tokyo
Cabinet C library.  The tokyocabinet.jar is included in the deps
directory and provides the hooks into the JNI library.  The JNI and C
libraries must be built separately.

This code is licensed under the Eclipse Public License, see
epl-v10.html.

Tokyo Cabinet is under the LGPL license, see the the sources in the
deps directory for that.
