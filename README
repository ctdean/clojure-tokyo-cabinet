An interface to Tokyo Cabinet and Tokyo Tyrant.  Tokyo Cabinet is a
modern implementation of DBM, similar in spirit to Berkeley DB.  See
http://1978th.net/tokyocabinet/

No documentation.
A few test.

We only support the B+ Tree Database.  No transactions.

You will need the Tokyo Cabinet Java library as well as the Tokyo
Cabinet C library.  The jar libraries can be downloaded using lein (or
your favorite maven tool).  The JNI and C libraries must be built
separately.

To use, just put all the jars in your CLASSPATH and make sure the jni
shared library is installed properly.

The jni bindings can be downloaded from
http://1978th.net/tokyocabinet/javapkg/ with supporting docs in
http://1978th.net/tokyocabinet/javadoc/

deps directory for that.
